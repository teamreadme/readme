# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Welcome to README! Want to learn more about what we're about? Check out our [website](https://readmefirst.co). Otherwise, continue below for hosting and contributing details. README is still in the early stages of being open-sourced, expect better documentation and code quality soon.

## Getting started
Want to run README yourself?

### Render
[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

### Self-hosted
```
me@home~: docker-compose up -d --build 
me@home~: # Database will mount to ~/.data/postgres on your localhost for persistence
```


## Contributing

### Local dev
To get started locally, make sure Docker Desktop has access to the local directory, and run the following
```
me@home~: docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d # Launches db
me@home~: npm i
me@home~: npm run migrate
me@home~: npm run dev # http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

#### Logging in
Create an account at https://ethereal.email/ and update the `.env` file to reference your authentication settings. That will be your email to sign in with

## Prisma
### Generate migration
`npx prisma migrate dev`

### Generate TS client
`npx prisma generate`

## Out of band infrastructure
README currently uses 2 pieces of infrastructure that are outside of render.com, listed below:

### SendGrid
[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) is used for email and marketing activities. If you would like to incorporate it into your deployment, provide the SendGrid API key to your render deployment and set up any emails or funnels in SendGrid. An onboarding email is a great start.

### LogSnag
[LogSnag](https://logsnag.com) is used for alerting on specific activities. It's a nice mechanism to let you know when new users sign up or offboard. If you would like to incorporate it into your deployment, provide the LogSnag API key to your render deployment. Do a repo-wide search for `logSnagPublish` to see what projects and channels to configure.
