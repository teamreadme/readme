# Sharing your README
So you've done it, you finally wrote your README, congratulations! Now comes the hard part, getting others to read and learn from it. While writing a README is as much an exercise in self-awareness as it is a public document about yourself, it's also a great tool for others to use to learn how to work with you. Here are 6 places you should include your README at work!

_Not sure what link to use? When editing your README, just copy the URL from your browser! https://readmefirst.co/[username] is all you need._

## 1️⃣ Slack
Don't forget to include your pronouns while you're at it!

- Click on your profile picture in the top right > Profile > Edit Profile and place your README link under "What I Do". 

## 2️⃣ Outlook
While maybe not appropriate to include in client-facing emails, including your README in your email signature for internal emails can really help others in the organization learn about you.

 - Click on New Message > Signatures > Manage Signatures and add it under your name!

## 3️⃣ Around
If your team is hanging out in an [Around](https://around.co/) room, share your link in chat while in that awkward period before everyone joins.

 - Click on the chat window in the bottom of the room, and paste your link!

## 4️⃣ Twitter
Really want to introduce yourself to the world? Add your README to your twitter profile!

 - Click on Edit profile > Website

## 5️⃣ Instagram
For the aesthetic or social among us, Instagram is a great tool for documenting your life, much like README!

 - Click on your profile picture > Settings and paste your README link in either "Website" or "Bio".

## 6️⃣ Internal Wikis
Many organizations use an internal wiki or documentation site. Maybe they already have a dedicated place for READMEs! Create a new page or contribute to an existing section by including a link to your README!

Has using README helped you resolve differences in the workplace, or increased productivity? Let us know on twitter [@teamreadme](https://twitter.com/teamreadme)!
