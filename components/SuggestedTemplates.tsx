    <h1>ðŸŽ‰ Hi There!</h1>
    <p>Thanks for checking out my README! I'm really happy you're considering joining [awesome start up]. You can consider this a user guide to me as a recruiter and a guide to the company. Inside you'll find things like my career journey, my hopes for candidates I work with, and some secret tips to interviewing with us.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>My Career Journey</h2>
    <p>Before joining [awesome start up] I was a director of HR at [not so awesome mega corp]. This is a great place to tell people about your career journey. Don't be humble, let them know how successful you are!</p>
    <h2>Working Together</h2>
    <p>I will do everything in my power to help you succeed in this process. My job is to help you perform your best as we move through the couple steps in our interviewing process. With that being said, here are a couple ideas for how we can best work together:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Quick communication&nbsp;</strong>- I will promise to give you clear and quick communication. We don't ðŸ‘» people here. All I ask in return is that if you need some time to think or respond, just let me know! I'm happy to give you a couple days to think things over</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency</strong> - We pride ourselves on transparency and try to make sure we aren't putting our interests above your own. That's why you'll notice we had salary ranges included in the job posting. We feel a successful negotation is one where everyone walks away happy.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback</strong> - You'll receive feedback after each round of interviews and we would love the same! Don't hesitate to let us know how we can improve. Once you join us, you might be one of the interviewers!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Secret Tips</h2>
    <p>We're super casual here and a core tenant is accessibility, which means there's no hidden social code. The only secret tip to working with us is be yourself! Have fun during the interviews and don't be afraid to advocate for yourself.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¥ Hey Team</h2>
  <p>I heard about this new README craze and wanted to give it a try. Inside you'll find details about me as a person, manager, and peer of yours. I want to be the best leader I can for our team and that includes being open about myself and my progress as a leader.</p>
  <h2>Leadership Style</h2>
  <p>I'm a big proponent of Participative Leadership and a big part of that is making information about myself and our business readily available to the team.</p>
  <p>If you ever feel I'm being argumentative, it's perfectly okay to say so! I love a good debate, but understand it can come off a bit terse at times.</p>
  <h2>Growing up</h2>
  <p>I feel my childhood is a huge part of who I am, so I felt it important to include in here. I grew up in Boston, Massachusetts and unfortunately hate the Red Sox ðŸ˜¥. It feels good to get that off my chest.</p>
  <h2>A Month as Me</h2>
  <h3>Daily</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>What do you do every day? Coffee, 1:1s, jogging?</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Weekly</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>What do you do every week? Meetings, routines, reports...</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Monthly</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>What do you do every month? Solve a rubik's cube, meet with your VP, go through feedback</li>
  </ol>

        <h1>ðŸ“Ÿ Is this thing on?</h1>
        <p>As I imagine some of you may know, my name&apos;s Hans and I&apos;m the Founder &amp; CEO of [awesome startup]. Now that we&apos;ve grown to 500 (!) employees, I&apos;ve noticed that it&apos;s hard for me to get time with everyone and a lot of people don&apos;t get the chance to speak with me. Since accessibility is one of our core values, I wanted to make sure information about me is shared equally amongst the team in my README.</p>
        <h2>Creating [awesome startup]</h2>
        <p>I love telling stories about the early days founding this company. It started in my great aunt&apos;s garage with 2 Macbook Airs and a lot of bud light. I sometimes wish I could go back to those days, they seem simpler at times, but I don&apos;t ever want to go back to not having this awesome team beside me.</p>
        <h2>Quirks</h2>
        Everyone has them and it&apos;s important to be aware of mine. I don&apos;t ever want one my quirks to cause someone to feel left out or uncomfortable, so please tell me if you notice that happening.
        <ol>
            <li>Eye contact can be hard for me at times. But I promise I&apos;m listening! I just think better when staring off into space.</li>
            <li>I <b><u>love</u></b> Broadway musicals, so much that you might hear me humming it while walking down the street</li>
            <li>I sometimes make up words. I wish I knew why, but occassionally there&apos;s an itch in my brain and that&apos;s the only way to scratch it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <p>I've found those that solve problems not given to them succeed first. I'm always open to helping with any problems you may have, but I ask that you come up with at least one potential solution. Even if it seems outlandish, it shows me that the problem matters to you and you are willing to find a solution.</p>
